# FinTech Case Study: Origins of a Successful Fintech Company

## Overview and Origin

- Social Finance SOFI

- When was the company incorporated?
  SOFI began as a startup amongst Stanford MBA Candidates. They used an alumni-funded Lending Model to refinance the student loan debt of recent graduates. This ocurred in 2011.1*

- Who are the founders of the company?
  A group of Graduate students from Stanford founded the company, naming Mike Cagney, project lead, CEO. However, what appears to be a maladaptive characteristic of Fintech startups, in typical fashion, the capital, professionalisms, and workplace behavior conducive to growth lacked. This culminated for SOFI in 2017 when Mike Cagney was removed as CEO, the result of a scathing New York Times article assusing the executive team of innapropraite sexual harrassment and instilled a "Fraternity-like" culture. The 6 year old startup was sold to angel investors more familiar with banking and regulatory bodies. In fact, what began as a unique and intelligent innovative way to underwrite loans by using more rapidly accessible and less expensive data points to target customers did not yield any new innovations, aside from adding unsecured personal loans and expanding the refinance business nationwide, post launch. However, the retooled Startup brought on Anthony Novato, the Twitter CFO to take Cagney's place as CEO. They are now, three years later, the first AAA rated Fintech Lendetr.2*

- How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

  American's, and sadly around 5 billion people word-wide, will not be able to borrow money, be it in the form of a credit card, mortgage, or personal loan because the means by which creditworthyniss is assessed, using credit reports and debt to income ratios, are not sufficient to properly guage the credit worthyness of a potential customer. The Stanford project ignored traditional underwriting regulations, allowable as this was a privately funded program through the university Almumn, initially. The notion that an Ivy league graduate school grad, working in high paying professional sectors such as Law and Medicine may be denied a loan due to amount of student debt without properly factoring in future earning potential was silly to them. They realized Data Science and analytics of information readily available to them prooved to be a better indicator of credit worthyness than credit reports.4*

- How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
  The founding board funded the initial project to establish equity stake in the company. They soon did a round of crowdfunding that allowed them to grow until the company's apparent downfall became an exponential growth factor for them.

## Business Activities:

- What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  SOFI is trying to become the world's first full service online bank. This goal coincides with the ESG Trend to offer socially responsible spending hasbits, with much of their website dedicated to educating their target audience, Millenials. Millenials and Gen Y/Z populations will be the ones utilizing the watershed changes fintewch banking affords. Their marketing, through gaming apps etc. is demonstrable of that. By partnering with medium size banks, on the verge of collapse=but with the licenses and regulatory knowledge to avert excessive government penalties, SOFI is able to solve the problem of cost. By saving so much using newer programs and apps, they are able to offer APY at a significantly higher percentage than the standard barely above prime interest rate. They offer this in a basic savings/checking hybrid, which then allows them to use spending data to market their newer products, which were able to be developed due to the existing traditional entities' doing the actual work after customer aquisiton.6*

- Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

SOFI makes use of an appearing closed system, similar to apple. Targetd marketing and simple accessible products, with speady approval locks the customer in as a SOFI Member, and they use events to build both a physical and online community. The use of facebook groups and pages has been highly successful for them too.1* & 7*

## Landscape:

- What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
  Peer to peer payment, Lending, Refinaancing debt, regulatory assistance from rapidly growing regulations making another one of their domains possible: trading cryptocurrenciers and offering algorythmic based investing.

- What are the other major companies in this domain?
  There are companies such as Lending Club, Upstart, and Kabbage that offer some of these products piecemiel, but no one who offers all.4*

## Recommendations

My advice to SOFI is to continue engaging the customer through excellent service, while outsourcing and helping older institutions with more experience catchup to the times. This ultimately is designed to shrink the wealth gap in the United States.
